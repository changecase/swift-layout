# Swift Documents

Use these files as a base for all of your InDesign page layout needs.

## Master Pages

The following master pages are available for use:

- **[None]** You've seen this before. It provides the same kind of layout it always
  does, none. Use this if you need to get as far away from the Swift Layout as possible.
- **2C-2 Column** The default layout is a 2 column landscape.
- **VH1C-vertical half page** Use an image with bleed on the three outer edges and a 
  single column to draw attention to your important image.
- **SH1C-square, half page image** Use an image with bleed on only the spine-opposite
  edge and a single column.
- **2Stk-two stacked, horizontal images** Use this layout when you need to display two
  longer images on a single page.
- **4C-s-four column, spread spanning image** A long, thin image spans the top of the
  entire spread, leaving the rest of the space for four columns (two per page).

## Paragraph Styles

- **\[Basic Paragraph\]** has taken the place of simliar "Default" or "Normal" paragraph
  styles in word processing programs. Use this to make a basic paragraph.
- **Headings** houses all of the heading type styles in Swift Layout.
    - **Title** is used for declaring titles of articles.
    - **Heading 1** is used for the top level heading(s) of an article.
    - **Heading 2** is used for the main sections within a heading of an article.
    - **Heading 3** is used for the sub-sections withn Heading 2.

## Character Styles

- **\[None\]** Does about what you'd expect. It removes any declared character styles 
  from the active text.
- **Strong** Is used to call attention to important terms within flow of the body copy (aka, the \[Basic Paragraph\]s).
